    <p>Loss control is an important component of fire department service delivery with the philosophy of minimizing secondary damage

  notes: `
    <ol>
    <li>Salvage and overhaul operations are two of the most effective means of loss control.</li>
    <li>
    It is very important for fire personnel to identify and protect valuable contents
    in structures affected by fire as well as searching for hidden fires so
    rekindling does not occur.
    </li>
    <li>
    Taking a customer-service oriented approach to loss control ensures that citizensâ€™ property is adequately protected
    and that the reputation of the fire service is held in the highest regard.

      question: 'How does the philosophy of loss control impact fire suppression?',
      answer: `
        <p><strong>Loss Control</strong> - Practice of minimizing damage and providing customer service through effective mitigation and recovery efforts before, during, and after an incident.</p>
        <h5>Properly applied loss control activities include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minimizing damage to the structure, exposures, and contents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminating the possibility of a fire re-igniting in the structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reducing the amount of time needed to repair and reopen for business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce stress on the owner/occupants of the structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create goodwill for the fire department within the community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minimize financial losses to the owner, occupant, insurance company, and community.
          </li>

    {
      question: 'In what ways can precedent planning influence loss control?',
      answer: `
        <p>Preincident Planning helps to save the most critical things for business owners or families affected by a fire. For example, the owner may accept losing the structure itself as long as proprietary items such as client information and financial records are preserved.
        Some businesses never recover from a fire due to the loss of such critical items,
         even if they are fully insured.</p>
        <p>Effective loss control depends on good planning.</p>
        <h5>Loss control concerns that should be identified during a preincident plan include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most effective and least destructive means of gaining access to the structure (lockboxes, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
           The most effective means of evacuating or protecting building occupants during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          The location of vital business records (computer servers, filing cabinets, vaults)
          in the structure and how to best protect them during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          When and how built-in fire suppression systems, such as automatic
          sprinklers and standpipes, are to be supported and used.
          </li>
          <li>
          How building contents are to be protected from smoke and water damage
          (salvage covers, plastic sheeting, removal from the structure, etc.).

    {
      question: 'What is the best way to determine appropriate salvage procedures?',
      answer: `
        <p>
        The IC should make any decisions about delaying fire suppression affer taking into consideration
        the preincident plan, fire development, and any unsafe structural conditions.
        </p>
        <h5>The choice of salvage procedures will depend on:</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Number of personnel available.</li>
        <li>Extent and location of the fire.</li>
        <li>Type, size, and quantity of the contents.</li>

          <li>Vinyl.</li>
          <li>Disposable heavy-duty plastic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Salvage covers are made of <strong>waterproof canvas or vinyl</strong> and are manufactured in various sizes. These covers have reinforced corners and edge hems into which grommets are placed for hanging or draping. Vinyl synthetic covers are lightweight,
          easy to handle, economical, and practical for both indoor and outdoor use.</p>
          <p>Many departments use disposable <strong>heavy-duty plastic</strong> covers. The plastic is available on rolls and can be extended as needed to cover large areas. Covers can also be cut from the rolls
          in different shapes and sizes as needed. </p>

        <p>Improvised salvage covers catch and route water away from a location.</p>
        <h5>There are several different methods for folding/rolling and spreading covers:</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>One-Firefighter Spread with a Rolled Salvage Cover.</li>

      question: 'How can a firefighter describe the factors that influence locating hidden fires?',
      answer: `
          <h5>There are four methods to use when locating hidden fires:</h5>
          <ul>
          <li>Sight - discoloration of materials, peeling paint, smoke emissions from cracks,
           cracked plaster, rippled wallpaper and burned areas.</li>
          <li>Touch - heat felt through walls and floors.</li>
          <li>Sound - popping or cracking of fire burning and hissing of steam.</li>
          <li>Electronic Sensors - thermal(heat) signature detection with thermal imager and infrared heat detection.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The structural condition of an area must be evaluated before searching for hidden fires!</p>

      question: 'What are some of the overhaul procedures used in the fire service?',
      answer: `
        <p>Overhaul procedures should begin as soon as possible after the order is given.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the fire extended to other areas, determine the path.</li>
        <li>If floor beams have burned at party wall ends, overhaul the ends by flushing the voids
        in the wall with water.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly check insulation materials because they can
        retain hidden fires for a prolonged period.</li>
        <li>Do not make random openings.</li>
        <li>Understanding basic building construction can help.</li>
        <li>Search in concealed spaces.</li>
        <li>Make openings in neat, planned manner.</li>
        <li>Open ceilings from below.</li>
        <li>When pulling any ceiling, do not stand directly under the area to be opened.</li>
        <li>Always wear full PPE including respiratory protection when pulling ceilings.</li>
        <li>Small burning objects frequently uncovered.</li>
        <li>Large smoldering items such as mattresses etc. should be taken outside the structure where they
        can be thoroughly extinguished.</li>
        <li>Do not disturb evidence, work in close coordination with the fire investigator.</li>
        <li>The use of wetting agents such as Class A foam is of considerable value when extinguishing hidden fires..</li>
        <li>The only way to ensure that fires in bales of items such as rags, cotton, and hay are extinguished
        is to break them apart.</li>

      question: 'How can using thermal imager be useful during overhaul?',
      answer: `
        <p>Firefighters can use TIs to find hidden fires in concealed spaces such a floors,
         ceilings, and walls without having to open up the areas and visually inspect them. This
         reduces the time needed to perform a search and limits the secondary
         damage to the structure</p>
