      <h3>CO Facts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>CO is produced any time a fuel is burned. Potential sources include gas or oil furnaces, water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers, barbecue grills, fireplaces,
wood-burning stoves, gas ovens, generators, and car exhaust fumes.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America. (Centers for Disease Control)</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>More than two-thirds of Americans use gas, wood, kerosene or another fuel as their home's major heat source.</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>65% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths from consumer products are due to heating systems.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Only 50% of homes in America have CO alarms, according to industry surveys.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>An idling vehicle in an attached garage, even with the garage door opened, can produce concentrated amounts of CO that can enter your home through the garage door or nearby windows.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Portable generators were involved in the majority of CO deaths involving engine-driven tools from 1999 through 2012. (CPSC)</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>A poorly maintained gas stove can give off twice the amount of CO than one that is in good working order.</p></li>

<h3>Tips for Prevention</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>Install at least one battery-powered CO alarm or AC-powered unit with battery backup on each level of your home and near sleeping areas.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Do not use charcoal or gas grills inside or operate outdoors near a window where CO fumes could seep in.</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>Check all CO alarms in your home. Do they use the most accurate sensing technology? Do they need new batteries?</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>Replace CO alarms every five to seven years to benefit from the latest technology upgrades.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Have a licensed professional inspect heating systems and other fuel-burning appliances annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>Install fuel-burning appliances properly and operate them according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Keep chimneys clear of animal nests, leaves and residue to ensure proper venting. Have all fireplaces cleaned and inspected annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>Do not block or seal shut the exhaust flues or ducts used by water heaters, ranges and clothes dryers.</p></li>
<li><strong>9</strong><p>Do not leave your car running in an attached garage or carport.</p></li>
<li><strong>10</strong><p>Do not use ovens or stoves to heat your home.</p></li>
