    <p>
    So you want to be a firefighter. Well, there's a lot to learn first.
    For example, is it considered arson if the property a person burns
    is his or her own? And what should you do if you arrive at a call
    and find out that it was a false alarm?

        question: 'Which of these qualifies as a first responder?',
        answer: `Civilians are often first responders - people who provide
    help at the scene of an emergency until professional help arrives.
    Many fire departments teach courses like "CERT,"
    which stands for Community Emergency Response Training.`,

        answer: `This happens from time to time. Even if the caller only

        it's still considered "good intent." They should not be blamed for a false alarm.`,

        <p><strong>Loss Control</strong> - Practice of minimizing damage and providing customer service through effective mitigation and recovery efforts before, during, and after an incident.</p>
        <h5>Properly applied loss control activities include:</h5>

          <li>
            Minimizing damage to the structure, exposures, and contents.
          </li>

            Eliminating the possibility of a fire re-igniting in the structure.

        question: 'In what ways can precedent planning influence loss control?',
        answer: `
        <p>Preincident Planning helps to save the most critical things for business owners or families affected by a fire. For example, the owner may accept losing the structure itself as long as proprietary items such as client information and financial records are preserved.
        Some businesses never recover from a fire due to the loss of such critical items,
         even if they are fully insured.</p>
        <p>Effective loss control depends on good planning.</p>
        <h5>Loss control concerns that should be identified during a preincident plan include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most effective and least destructive means of gaining access to the structure (lockboxes, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
           The most effective means of evacuating or protecting building occupants during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          The location of vital business records (computer servers, filing cabinets, vaults)
          in the structure and how to best protect them during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          When and how built-in fire suppression systems, such as automatic
          sprinklers and standpipes, are to be supported and used.
          </li>
          <li>
          How building contents are to be protected from smoke and water damage

        the preincident plan, fire development, and any unsafe structural conditions.

          <p>Many departments use disposable <strong>heavy-duty plastic</strong> covers. The plastic is available on rolls and can be extended as needed to cover large areas. Covers can also be cut from the rolls

      <h3>CO Facts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>CO is produced any time a fuel is burned. Potential sources include gas or oil furnaces, water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers, barbecue grills, fireplaces,
wood-burning stoves, gas ovens, generators, and car exhaust fumes.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America. (Centers for Disease Control)</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>More than two-thirds of Americans use gas, wood, kerosene or another fuel as their home's major heat source.</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>65% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths from consumer products are due to heating systems.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Only 50% of homes in America have CO alarms, according to industry surveys.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>An idling vehicle in an attached garage, even with the garage door opened, can produce concentrated amounts of CO that can enter your home through the garage door or nearby windows.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Portable generators were involved in the majority of CO deaths involving engine-driven tools from 1999 through 2012. (CPSC)</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>A poorly maintained gas stove can give off twice the amount of CO than one that is in good working order.</p></li>
</ol>
<img src="${coScheme}">
<h3>Tips for Prevention</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>Install at least one battery-powered CO alarm or AC-powered unit with battery backup on each level of your home and near sleeping areas.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Do not use charcoal or gas grills inside or operate outdoors near a window where CO fumes could seep in.</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>Check all CO alarms in your home. Do they use the most accurate sensing technology? Do they need new batteries?</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>Replace CO alarms every five to seven years to benefit from the latest technology upgrades.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Have a licensed professional inspect heating systems and other fuel-burning appliances annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>Install fuel-burning appliances properly and operate them according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Keep chimneys clear of animal nests, leaves and residue to ensure proper venting. Have all fireplaces cleaned and inspected annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>Do not block or seal shut the exhaust flues or ducts used by water heaters, ranges and clothes dryers.</p></li>
<li><strong>9</strong><p>Do not leave your car running in an attached garage or carport.</p></li>
<li><strong>10</strong><p>Do not use ovens or stoves to heat your home.</p></li>
