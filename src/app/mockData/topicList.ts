    <p>
    So you want to be a firefighter. Well, there's a lot to learn first.
    For example, is it considered arson if the property a person burns
    is his or her own? And what should you do if you arrive at a call
    and find out that it was a false alarm?

        question: 'Which of these qualifies as a first responder?',
        answer: `Civilians are often first responders - people who provide
    help at the scene of an emergency until professional help arrives.
    Many fire departments teach courses like "CERT,"
    which stands for Community Emergency Response Training.`,

        answer: `Obviously, not all fire-setting is arson. Letting a
    backcountry campfire get out of hand can result in civil charges,

        answer: `A physical abilities test isn't just a test of your physical
     strength and stamina. You'll be showing evaluators
     that you can do actual tasks that are part of the job.

        it would be rare for a department to ask you to do it as part
        of the exam! Once on board, you'd be given training and practice

        answer: `This happens from time to time. Even if the caller only
         believed there was a fire, but was wrong,
        it's still considered "good intent." They should not be blamed for a false alarm.`,

            Minimizing damage to the structure, exposures, and contents.

        question: 'In what ways can precedent planning influence loss control?',
        answer: `
        <p>Preincident Planning helps to save the most critical things for business owners or families affected by a fire. For example, the owner may accept losing the structure itself as long as proprietary items such as client information and financial records are preserved.
        Some businesses never recover from a fire due to the loss of such critical items,
         even if they are fully insured.</p>

        <h5>Loss control concerns that should be identified during a preincident plan include:</h5>
        <ul>

            The most effective and least destructive means of gaining access to the structure (lockboxes, etc.).

           The most effective means of evacuating or protecting building occupants during a fire.

          <li>
          The location of vital business records (computer servers, filing cabinets, vaults)
          in the structure and how to best protect them during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          When and how built-in fire suppression systems, such as automatic
          sprinklers and standpipes, are to be supported and used.
          </li>
          <li>
          How building contents are to be protected from smoke and water damage

        the preincident plan, fire development, and any unsafe structural conditions.

      <h3>CO Facts</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>CO is produced any time a fuel is burned. Potential sources include gas or oil furnaces, water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers, barbecue grills, fireplaces,
wood-burning stoves, gas ovens, generators, and car exhaust fumes.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning deaths in America. (Centers for Disease Control)</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>More than two-thirds of Americans use gas, wood, kerosene or another fuel as their home's major heat source.</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>65% of carbon monoxide poisoning deaths from consumer products are due to heating systems.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Only 50% of homes in America have CO alarms, according to industry surveys.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>An idling vehicle in an attached garage, even with the garage door opened, can produce concentrated amounts of CO that can enter your home through the garage door or nearby windows.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Portable generators were involved in the majority of CO deaths involving engine-driven tools from 1999 through 2012. (CPSC)</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>A poorly maintained gas stove can give off twice the amount of CO than one that is in good working order.</p></li>
</ol>
<img src="${coScheme}">
<h3>Tips for Prevention</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>1</strong><p>Install at least one battery-powered CO alarm or AC-powered unit with battery backup on each level of your home and near sleeping areas.</p></li>
<li><strong>2</strong><p>Do not use charcoal or gas grills inside or operate outdoors near a window where CO fumes could seep in.</p></li>
<li><strong>3</strong><p>Check all CO alarms in your home. Do they use the most accurate sensing technology? Do they need new batteries?</p></li>
<li><strong>4</strong><p>Replace CO alarms every five to seven years to benefit from the latest technology upgrades.</p></li>
<li><strong>5</strong><p>Have a licensed professional inspect heating systems and other fuel-burning appliances annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>6</strong><p>Install fuel-burning appliances properly and operate them according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></li>
<li><strong>7</strong><p>Keep chimneys clear of animal nests, leaves and residue to ensure proper venting. Have all fireplaces cleaned and inspected annually.</p></li>
<li><strong>8</strong><p>Do not block or seal shut the exhaust flues or ducts used by water heaters, ranges and clothes dryers.</p></li>
<li><strong>9</strong><p>Do not leave your car running in an attached garage or carport.</p></li>
<li><strong>10</strong><p>Do not use ovens or stoves to heat your home.</p></li>

    <li>DO NOT open the door until you have a changed hoseline and are ready to control the

    <li>Basement fires weaken the main floor of a structure creating a constant danger of structural collapse.</li>
    <li>Thermal imagers (TI) will not always provide an accurate assessment of the structural integrity of the floor system.</li>
    <li>Natural gas that leaks underground in wet soil can lose its odorant and become difficult to detect without instruments.</li>
    <li>Solar panels generate current whenever there is a light source (sunlight, moonlight, artificial lighting) and are always energized (one solar panel can generate
    enough power to kill a person).</li>
    <li>Added water weight from master stream operations increases the potential for structural collapse.</li>
    <li>Before initiating fire suppression activities, stop the flow of electricity to the device involved.</li>
    <li>Assume that all power energized until the power company informs you otherwise.</li>
    <li>Only personnel who are properly trained and equipped for confined-space entry should enter a utility vault.</li>
    <li>Before cutting into walls and ceiling that may contain electrical wiring or gas piping,
    verify with the IC that electrical and gas utilities have been shut off.</li>
    <li>[Electrical Emergencies] To exit a ground gradient area, keep both feet in contact with each other and hop or shuffle out of the affected area.</li>
    <li>[Vehicle fire attack] There may be no visual indicators that a vehicle uses an alternative fuel source.</li>
    <li>[Vehicle fire attack] Do not cut contact any orange, blue, or yellow color-coded electrical cables or components in electric or hybrid vehicles.</li>

    during the overhaul phase of an operation.</li>
    <li>Do not allow additional assigned duties to prevent tou from deploying in your primary rescue capacity when working as a RIC/RIT member.</li>
