    <p>
    So you want to be a firefighter. Well, there's a lot to learn first.
    For example, is it considered arson if the property a person burns
    is his or her own? And what should you do if you arrive at a call
    and find out that it was a false alarm?

        question: 'Which of these qualifies as a first responder?',
        answer: `Civilians are often first responders - people who provide
    help at the scene of an emergency until professional help arrives.
    Many fire departments teach courses like "CERT,"
    which stands for Community Emergency Response Training.`,

        answer: `Obviously, not all fire-setting is arson. Letting a
    backcountry campfire get out of hand can result in civil charges,
    but it's highly unlikely campers would be charged with arson.`,

        answer: `A physical abilities test isn't just a test of your physical
     strength and stamina. You'll be showing evaluators
     that you can do actual tasks that are part of the job.

        answer: `While public speaking about fire safety is part of the job,
        it would be rare for a department to ask you to do it as part
        of the exam! Once on board, you'd be given training and practice

        question: 'If you turn out for a call, but the fire is out by the time you get there, you should ....',
        answer: `This happens from time to time. Even if the caller only
         believed there was a fire, but was wrong,
        it's still considered "good intent." They should not be blamed for a false alarm.`,

        <p><strong>Loss Control</strong> - Practice of minimizing damage and providing customer service through effective mitigation and recovery efforts before, during, and after an incident.</p>
        <h5>Properly applied loss control activities include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Minimizing damage to the structure, exposures, and contents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminating the possibility of a fire re-igniting in the structure.

            Reducing the amount of time needed to repair and reopen for business.

        question: 'In what ways can precedent planning influence loss control?',
        answer: `
        <p>Preincident Planning helps to save the most critical things for business owners or families affected by a fire. For example, the owner may accept losing the structure itself as long as proprietary items such as client information and financial records are preserved.
        Some businesses never recover from a fire due to the loss of such critical items,
         even if they are fully insured.</p>
        <p>Effective loss control depends on good planning.</p>
        <h5>Loss control concerns that should be identified during a preincident plan include:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The most effective and least destructive means of gaining access to the structure (lockboxes, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
           The most effective means of evacuating or protecting building occupants during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          The location of vital business records (computer servers, filing cabinets, vaults)
          in the structure and how to best protect them during a fire.
          </li>
          <li>
          When and how built-in fire suppression systems, such as automatic
          sprinklers and standpipes, are to be supported and used.
          </li>
          <li>
          How building contents are to be protected from smoke and water damage

        the preincident plan, fire development, and any unsafe structural conditions.

          <p>Many departments use disposable <strong>heavy-duty plastic</strong> covers. The plastic is available on rolls and can be extended as needed to cover large areas. Covers can also be cut from the rolls
