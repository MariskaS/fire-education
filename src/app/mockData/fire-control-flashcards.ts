      answer: `
        <p>Your duties and assigned tasks will depend on your departmental standardization
        procedures(SOPs), your assigned job on your company, the amount of fire involvement,
        and the type of structure involved.

      question: 'What are the factors that must be considered when making entry?',
      answer: `
<p>The IC supervisor will decide where and from what direction to make entry for an interior fire attack.
Generally, attack hoselines are placed to protect firefighters, occupants, and property. However, you should be aware of some of the
factors that are used to make the decision, which include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wind direction and velocity</li>
<li>Building construction</li>
<li>Initial fire location</li>
<li>Location of occupants</li>
<li>Exposures</li>
</ul><br/>
<p>Additional pre-entry considerations critical to firefighter safety and effectiveness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the fire behavior indicators</li>
<li>Understand the crew's tactical assignment</li>
<li>Identify emergency escape routes</li>
<li>Ensure SCBA is operating functionally</li>
<li>Ensure PASS is functioning</li>
<li>Verify radio transmission</li>
<li>Identify hazards</li>
<li>Evaluate forcible entry requirements</li>

  notes: `
    <ol>
    <li>DO NOT open the door until you have a changed hoseline and are ready to control the
    conditions encountered.</li>
    <li>Basement fires weaken the main floor of a structure creating a constant danger of structural collapse.</li>
    <li>Thermal imagers (TI) will not always provide an accurate assessment of the structural integrity of the floor system.</li>
    <li>Natural gas that leaks underground in wet soil can lose its odorant and become difficult to detect without instruments.</li>
    <li>Solar panels generate current whenever there is a light source (sunlight, moonlight, artificial lighting) and are always energized (one solar panel can generate
    enough power to kill a person).</li>
    <li>Added water weight from master stream operations increases the potential for structural collapse.</li>
    <li>Before initiating fire suppression activities, stop the flow of electricity to the device involved.</li>
    <li>Assume that all power energized until the power company informs you otherwise.</li>
    <li>Only personnel who are properly trained and equipped for confined-space entry should enter a utility vault.</li>
    <li>Before cutting into walls and ceiling that may contain electrical wiring or gas piping,
    verify with the IC that electrical and gas utilities have been shut off.</li>
    <li>[Electrical Emergencies] To exit a ground gradient area, keep both feet in contact with each other and hop or shuffle out of the affected area.</li>
    <li>[Vehicle fire attack] There may be no visual indicators that a vehicle uses an alternative fuel source.</li>
    <li>[Vehicle fire attack] Do not cut contact any orange, blue, or yellow color-coded electrical cables or components in electric or hybrid vehicles.</li>
    <li>[Trash Container Fires] Ground cover fires can be deadly to firefighters even if they are working in very light fuel or working
    during the overhaul phase of an operation.</li>
    <li>Do not allow additional assigned duties to prevent tou from deploying in your primary rescue capacity when working as a RIC/RIT member.</li>
    <li>PPE soiled with flammable and combustible liquids may ignite when exposed to heat.</li>
    <li>Only firefighters who have practiced using hoselines for crew protection should do so during an emergency.</li>
    <li>If gas is burning from a broken gas pipe, do not extinguish the fire. Provide protection for exposures.</li>
